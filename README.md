# Conways Game of Life

## Project requirements
* Use your preferred language or framework to build an implementation of [Conways Game of Life](https://github.com/lemmine/conway/blob/master/public/Game%20of%20Life%20Exercise%20Candidate%20Instructions.pdf)
* Ensure your code is written to a high quality and is maintainable
* State any assumptions you havemade about the problem

## Assumptions
* To emlate an infinate 2D grid, a finite grid with looping edges will be used
* The games seed can be specified by either clicking on the grid to set the cells state or by using one of the pre defined scenarios
* To ensure high quality and maintainable code, the following decisions have been made:
	* The code has been written using meaningful variable names and is well commented to increase readability
	* The Vue.js framework has been used to enfore a modular, standardised, and organised design
	* The UI has been decoupled from the game logic by using Vue.js components
